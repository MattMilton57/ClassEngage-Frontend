Working on the edit class page. Just got the functionality working on the generate the student body page. 
I found that I had to make sure that I wasnt sending multiple "undefined" calls to my roster generator component
(i had them coming from my classHome component as well as my Generate current class list component) because 
with each call the roster generator was trying to map through the unefined packet and getting fucked. 

next up. work on getting the current class list to appear possibly add a blank array to the current class state
for now just so that we can get the actual logic going. Add the button onto the student body generator so that 
you can add the student to the new class and remove them from the student body After that work on the fetches 
needed to create the registration and the logic to change state fro student body and enrolled. might need a state
for registrations connected to the current class.  Dont forget to look at ClassEngage 1.0 as im pretty sure a lot 
of the logic for this is in there. Might be something you can cull from it. 

Holy crap this chair is amazing.
