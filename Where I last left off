working on the logic that sends 5 students to the assessment container.
currently hitting a bug where the list of students is sometimes less than 5 so this causes the app to crash when it runs out of students short of 5.
need to work on ligic that will make sure that the list is at 5, a loop that takes all of the students that are not in the lowest ammount of 
times assessed and cuts off the lowest number of them that is necessary to bring the to be asessed list up to 10.  
dont worry about randomizing these students for now, get to that later. 

overall pretty good work today, need to move the monitor down.
