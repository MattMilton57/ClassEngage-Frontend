* Working on login functionality, trying to figure out why im having trouble issuing a JWT token on login.






* should I build a "current schedule* state object into each student that lsts their classes?
might be usefull fr when im doing enrollments, wouldallow display of all classes and blocking of double registration in one period. 

also, might make for a nice student status or initial enrollment page where you can pick each class from a dropdown menu to set a students initial schedule and then it displays the currently enrolled clas in that area if its filled

perhaps the enroll student function is only present for administrator access? for principals and counselors but not for teachers?


*bug: when i go back to the class menu page after doing assessments, the page is not updated with the new assessments

*bug: in edit class, need to write logic to remove a kid from this.state.gonekids if they are put back into the class and vice versa
